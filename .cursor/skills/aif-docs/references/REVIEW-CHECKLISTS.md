# Documentation Review Checklists

## Technical Checklist

Verify structure, links, and completeness:

- [ ] README.md is under 150 lines
- [ ] README has: title, tagline, quick start, example, documentation table, license
- [ ] Each docs/ file has prev/next navigation header following the Documentation table order
- [ ] First doc page has no "← Previous" link; last page has no "Next →" link
- [ ] Each docs/ file has "See Also" section at bottom with 2-3 related links
- [ ] No content was lost during split/reorganization
- [ ] All internal links work (no broken references, no dead anchors)
- [ ] Code examples use the project's actual commands/syntax
- [ ] Installation instructions are real and work (verified from package manager files)
- [ ] No duplicate content between README and docs/
- [ ] No scattered root-level `.md` files that should be in docs/

## Readability Checklist — "New User Eyes"

Read every page as if you are a developer who has **never seen this project before**. For each page, verify:

### First 10 seconds (above the fold)
- [ ] Can I understand what this project does within 10 seconds of reading README?
- [ ] Is the tagline clear and specific — not vague marketing ("next-gen solution")?
- [ ] Is there a real install command I can copy-paste right now?

### "Show, don't tell"
- [ ] Does README have a concrete usage example (not just "install and run")?
- [ ] Do code blocks show real commands with real output, not abstract placeholders?
- [ ] Are examples copy-pasteable — no `<placeholder>` that the user must replace?

### Scannability
- [ ] Can I find any specific topic in under 5 seconds by scanning headers?
- [ ] Are paragraphs short (max 3-4 lines)? Long paragraphs get skipped
- [ ] Are lists used instead of comma-separated inline enumerations?
- [ ] Are tables used for structured data instead of nested bullet lists?

### Jargon and assumptions
- [ ] Does the docs page explain acronyms on first use (or link to explanation)?
- [ ] Are there no assumptions about internal knowledge? ("as described in the RFC" — which RFC?)
- [ ] Would a junior developer understand each page without asking a colleague?

### Navigation and flow
- [ ] After reading README, is it clear where to go next?
- [ ] After finishing any docs/ page, do prev/next links and "See Also" guide me logically forward?
- [ ] Is the Documentation table in README ordered by the path a new user would follow? (getting started → workflow → details)

### Motivation
- [ ] Does the README answer "why should I care?" before "how does it work?"
- [ ] Is there a "wow moment" — a feature or example that makes me want to try it?
- [ ] Does the docs structure feel inviting, not overwhelming? (max 6-8 doc pages)

## Standards Compliance Check

Docs may have been generated by an older version of this skill. Compare existing docs against current Core Principles and templates. Common gaps to detect:

| Missing standard | How to detect | Auto-fix |
|------------------|---------------|----------|
| No prev/next navigation | Header has only `[← Back to README]` without `·` links to sibling pages | Add prev/next links following Documentation table order |
| No "See Also" section | File ends without `## See Also` | Add section with 2-3 related page links |
| Old "Back to README" format | Link path or text doesn't match current pattern | Update to current format |
| Missing Documentation table in README | README has no table linking to docs/ pages | Add table |
| README too long | README is over 150 lines despite docs/ existing | Propose moving excess content to docs/ |

**When gaps are found**, include them in the audit report alongside content issues (Step 2.2). Treat them as regular improvements — show the plan and get user approval before applying.

**Do NOT ask "was this generated by an older version?"** — just silently detect what's missing and fix it. The user doesn't need to know about skill versioning; they just see their docs getting better.

## Presenting the Review

After running both checklists, present a summary:

```
📋 Documentation Review

Technical:
  ✅ All links verified (14 internal links, 0 broken)
  ✅ README is 108 lines
  ✅ All pages have navigation
  ⚠️  docs/api.md has a placeholder example — needs real endpoint

Readability:
  ✅ README explains purpose in first 10 seconds
  ✅ All code examples are copy-pasteable
  ⚠️  docs/architecture.md has a 12-line paragraph — should be split
  ⚠️  "CQRS" used without explanation in docs/architecture.md

Fixes applied:
  → Split long paragraph in docs/architecture.md into 3 shorter ones
  → Added "(Command Query Responsibility Segregation)" after first mention of CQRS
  → Replaced placeholder in docs/api.md with real endpoint example

All checks passed ✅
```
