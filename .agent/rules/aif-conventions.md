# AI Factory Conventions

## Workflow Structure

AI Factory organizes skills into three categories:

### Workflows (.agent/workflows/)
Action-oriented skills that execute specific tasks:
- `aif-plan.md` — Plan and develop new features
- `aif-fix.md` — Fix bugs with structured approach
- `aif-implement.md` — Execute plans step by step
- `aif-commit.md` — Create conventional commits
- `aif-review.md` — Code review checklist
- `aif-deploy.md` — Deployment automation
- `aif-ci.md` — CI/CD pipeline setup

### Skills (.agent/skills/)
Knowledge-based skills providing guidelines and patterns:
- `best-practices/` — Code quality standards
- `architecture/` — Architecture decision records
- Stack-specific skills generated by `/aif`

### Rules (.agent/rules/)
Always-active guardrails and conventions that apply to every interaction.

## Naming Convention

- Workflow files: `aif-{action}.md` (flat files)
- Skill directories: `{skill-name}/SKILL.md` (with supporting files)
- Rule files: `aif-{rule-name}.md`
